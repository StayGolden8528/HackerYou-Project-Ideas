# HackerYou-Project-Ideas
You might have guessed it! My first repository will serve as a basic text file to brainstorm project ideas for my Web Development Course beginning June 17, 2018. Felt it necessary to start learning Git as a necessary tool for learning and version control.
My knowledge of programming is very limited so my project ideas will be very basic funtional webpages to start.

Idea 1
  Travel Blog - Photography enthusiast, so I have a lot of travel photos and video I can incorporate into a webpage with commentary, recommendations, highlights and links.
  
Idea 2
  Online Record Store - sample my vinyl collection for images, include sample music, add to cart functionality and a simple check out form.
  
Idea 3  
  Build a corporate website for my employer - current corporate website has not been updated for years and could use a fresh look. There is lots of content and links in the page but as a project for a portfolio it could be rather useful.
